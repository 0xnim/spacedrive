Last year, we introduced Spacedrive to the world by open-sourcing the codebase on GitHub. The reception was nothing short of phenomenal, allowing us to secure $2m in venture funding. As of today, our dedicated remote team of nine continues to grow, celebrated by almost 20,000 stars on the repository. It's with immense anticipation and excitement that we present to you the public alpha of Spacedrive.

Spacedrive reimagines the traditional file explorer. Its modern interface design, cross-platform framework, and constantly expanding toolkit offer a seamless file management experience.

For this alpha release, downloads are available for [macOS](), [Windows](), and [Linux](). We're aware that there are some bugs and important features yet to be incorporated such as device connectivity, multi-select, and cloud support. Despite these, theres at lot to explore today. Add local folders, network locations, and external drives into your data library. Spacedrive will keep its database in sync with the underlying file system, extracting metadata, uniquely identifying files, and generating thumbnails. This allows you to organise and search your library even when the storage locations are offline. A job manager allows you to track the progress for each phase of indexing, copy/paste, encryption, media encoding, and more.

For a comprehensive overview of the features included in this release, check out our [changelog](). Your participation in this alpha release will help shape the future of Spacedrive, and we can't wait for you to try it.

## The Explorer

The primary interface in the Spacedrive app is the Explorer—designed as a familiar interface, it is the heart of the app. From here you can explore storage locations and devices in your network. It features 4 views, Icons, List, Columns and Media. All sidebar buttons open some variation of the Explorer.

In an upcoming release system locations such as "Desktop", "Documents", "Downloads", "Music", etc. will be automatically added to the Explorer with indexing disabled by default. For now, you can add them manually by clicking the `+` button in the sidebar.

## Underlying technology

Reinventing the file explorer is a tremendous task, from OS compatibility to synchronizing a highly scalable distributed database running on-device, we've tackled the most challenging engineering problems and developed entirely new technologies to realize the Spacedrive vision. Our tech stack has never been done before, yet is working beyond expectation—from developer experience to runtime performance.

[Prisma Client Rust](), [RSPC]() and [Specta]() are all libraries developed by members of our team initially for Spacedrive, but are now growing into their own communities, with Prisma officially sponsoring PCR and Tauri adopting Specta for its own type introspection from Rust to TypeScript.
