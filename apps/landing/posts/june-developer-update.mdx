Last year we introduced Spacedrive to the world by open-sourcing the codebase on GitHub, the response was amazing and we raised [$2m in venture funding](#). Today, we are a remote team of 9 and the repository has close to 20,000 stars. Today we are launching a public alpha.

Spacedrive is a new kind of file explorer. With modern interface design, cross platform architecture and a continuously growing suite of tools—its a seemless file mananging experience. Organize files at scale, across many storage locations. ...

This alpha release includes downloads for [macOS](), [Windows]() and [Linux](). While there are still bugs to be fixed and some core features to be added (such as connecting devices, multi-select and cloud support) we have built the foundations. Today, you can add local folders, network locations and external drives. Spacedrive will synchronize its database with the underlying file system. Extracting metadata, uniquely identifying files and generating thumbnails.

## The Explorer

The Explorer, designed as a familiar interface, is the heart of the app. From here you can explore storage locations and devices in your network. It features 4 views, Icons, List, Columns and Media.

## Underlying technology

Reinventing the file explorer is a tremendous task, from OS compatibility to synchronizing a highly scalable distributed database running on-device, we've tackled the most challenging engineering problems and developed entirely new technologies to realize the Spacedrive vision. Our tech stack has never been done before, yet is working beyond expectation—from developer experience to runtime performance.

[Prisma Client Rust](), [RSPC]() and [Specta]() are all libraries developed by members of our team initially for Spacedrive, but are now growing into their own communities, with Prisma officially sponsoring PCR and Tauri adopting Specta for its own type introspection from Rust to TypeScript.
